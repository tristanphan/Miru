## Install

Currently, the app supports iOS, Apple Silicon Macs, and Android, but the Android build may be buggy (see `Android Support` below)

### iOS

Currently, the only way to install without jailbreaking it is through AltStore. TestFlight may come at a later date if
there is funding because the Apple Developer Program is expensive

1. Set Up [AltStore](https://altstore.io/)
2. Download the IPA file from Releases
3. Install the file in AltStore

Drawback: You need to refresh the app every seven days

### Android

Download the APK from Releases and open it<br>
Allow app to install APKs if asked

### Apple Silicon Macs

Because
of Apple's security and my lack of a paid developer license, please compile the application yourself

## Build

To build for iOS or Apple Silicon Macs, you need to have macOS and Xcode. To build for Android, you need
the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio).

1. Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
    - Use `flutter doctor -v` to make sure everything works
2. Clone this repository and enter the directory - `git clone && cd`
3. Get Dependencies with `flutter pub get`
4. Build or Run (use `--release` if necessary)
    - iOS: `flutter build ipa`
    - Android: `flutter build apk`
        - APK File: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk` or `app-release.apk`
    - Run with `flutter run`

### To get an IPA file:

5. Copy `Runner.app` from `build/ios/archive/Runner.xcarchive/Products/Applications` to a folder named `Payload`
6. Compress the Payload folder and change the extension to `.ipa`

### To compile for Apple Silicon Macs:

5. Open `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` in Xcode
6. Set the scheme to `Runner > My Mac (Designed for iPad)`
7. Press Run
8. When the app opens, âŒ˜-click the app in the dock to get the Miru.app file
9. Copy Miru.app to /Applications/

## Android Notes

While this application compiles for Android, many of its features are untested. Here are some things to look out for:

- A page may buffer forever (usually fixable with the reload button)
- Fallback Mode's ads are harder to avoid since:
    1. Fullscreen is not entered automatically
    2. The player is the IFrame's player, even in fullscreen
    
## Apple Silicon Mac Notes

The only issue that I have noticed that is unique to Apple Silicon Macs is finicky persistent storage
